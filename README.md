# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-Solutions-in-Csharp
Here you will find my solutions to some of the real interview problems I was faced with in the past two years, as well as to some of the problems in the famous book "Cracking the Coding Interview", all in C#.

Note that for some problems, I found simpler solutions than the ones in the book, so it is not a copy of the exact solutions in the book.

Have fun with them.
